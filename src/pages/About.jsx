        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          FineWineCollector.com was founded in 2002 by Edward Mackauf in San
          Jose, California (south of Napa Valley). In 2017, it was acquired by
          Jim Shaw of The Shaw Collection and relocated to San Diego,
          California. From our inception, we have always been an Internet
          business designed to sell The Finest Wines at the Finest Prices. Our
          wines are only offered via the web and our email list. We are an
          Internet business that truly lives up to our name; we only sell fine
          wine. Additionally, we only sell wine that our research indicates is
          still tasting great. We do not sell wine that is considered “Past
          Maturity”, nor do we sell any wine that has been improperly stored.

          FineWineCollector.com specializes in California cult wines, First and
          Second Growth Bordeaux, Rare Champagne as well as some of the finest
          wines from Burgundy, Rhone, Italy and Australia. We only purchase wine
          that has been properly stored and acquired from reliable sources. All
          of our wines are kept in a temperature and humidity controlled wine
          cellar at our facility in San Diego, California. Not only do we sell
          the finest wines in the world, but we frequently have the lowest
          prices in the entire country according to Wine-Searcher.com. We look
          forward to being your "go to" place for fine and rare wines!!
